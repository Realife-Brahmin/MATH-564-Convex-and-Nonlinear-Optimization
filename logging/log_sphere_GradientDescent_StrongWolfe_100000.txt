Starting with initial point x = [0.0, -100.0, 11.0, -23.0].
Begin with the solver:
Iteration 1:
Let's try shifting x to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
StrongWolfe1 condition satisfied for Î± = 0.5
StrongWolfe2 condition satisfied for Î± = 0.5
Iteration 1: x = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] is a better point with new fval = 0.0.
Iteration 2:
Let's try shifting x to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
StrongWolfe1 condition satisfied for Î± = 0.5
StrongWolfe2 condition satisfied for Î± = 0.5
Iteration 2: x = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] is a better point with new fval = 0.0.
