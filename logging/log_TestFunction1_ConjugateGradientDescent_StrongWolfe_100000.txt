Starting with initial point x = [0.5, 0.5].
which has fval = 2.3739583333333334
Begin with the solver:
Iteration 1:
SW1 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.25
SW2 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.25
Iteration 1: x = [-0.37812500000000004, 0.875] is a better point with new fval = 1.4813255489449952.
Iteration 2:
Iteration 2: x = [-0.37812500000000004, 0.875] is a better point with new fval = 1.4813255489449952.
