Starting with initial point x = [20.0].
Begin with the solver:
Iteration 1:
Let's try shifting x to [-20.0]
Let's try shifting x to [0.0]
Armijo condition satisfied for Î² = 0.5
Iteration 1: x = [0.0] is a better point with new fval = 0.0.
Iteration 2:
Let's try shifting x to [0.0]
Armijo condition satisfied for Î² = 1.0
Iteration 2: x = [0.0] is a better point with new fval = 0.0.
