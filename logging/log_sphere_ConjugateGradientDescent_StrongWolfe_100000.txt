Starting with initial point x = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0].
which has fval = 3.85
Begin with the solver:
Iteration 1:
SW1 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.5
SW2 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.5
Iteration 1: x = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] is a better point with new fval = 0.0.
Convergence achieved in 2 iterations ðŸ˜„
