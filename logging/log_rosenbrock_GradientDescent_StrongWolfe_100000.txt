Starting with initial point x = [0.5, 1.0].
which has fval = 1.375
Begin with the solver:
Iteration 1:
SW1 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.125
SW2 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.125
Iteration 1: x = [1.0, 0.625] is a better point with new fval = 0.28125.
Iteration 101:
SW1 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.125
SW2 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.125
Iteration 101: x = [0.9990310768060143, 0.9976704213851474] is a better point with new fval = 1.2471932456402873e-6.
Iteration 201:
SW1 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.0625
SW2 satisfied for Î±â±¼ = 0.0625
Iteration 201: x = [0.9999862260760202, 0.9999687868866289] is a better point with new fval = 2.1659210445772104e-10.
